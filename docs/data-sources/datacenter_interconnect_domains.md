# apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domains (Data Source)

This data source returns Graph DB node IDs of `evpn_interconnect_group` (Interconnect Domain) nodes within the given Blueprint. Note that creation of multiple Interconnect Domain resources is not currently supported.

Optional `filters` can be used to select only interesting nodes.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example collects the IDs of any Interconnect Gateways which are configured
# with route_target 100:100 or 200:200

// find interesting Interconnect Domain IDs
data "apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domains" "selected" {
  blueprint_id = "007723b7-a387-4bb3-8a5e-b5e9f265de0d"
  filters = [ { route_target = "100:100" }, { route_target = "200:200" } ]
}

output "interconnect_domain_ids" { value = data.apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domains.selected.ids }

// The output looks like this:
//
//   interconnect_domain_ids = toset([
//     "On_FQ5OGrUYCDGW14A",
//     "nn2Q3ar3ERM4okQ0cw",
//   ])
```

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint to search.

### Optional

- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters used to select only desired node IDs. For a nodeto match a filter, all specified attributes must match (each attribute within a filter is AND-ed together). The returned node IDs represent the nodes matched by all of the filters together (filters are OR-ed together). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))

### Read-Only

- `graph_queries` (List of String) The graph datastore queries based on `filters` which were used to perform the lookup.
- `ids` (Set of String) IDs of matching `evpn_interconnect_group` Graph DB nodes.

<a id="nestedatt--filters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filters`

Optional:

- `esi_mac` (String) Each site requires a unique site id iESI at the MAC-VRF level. This can be auto-derived or manually set.
- `id` (String) Apstra graph node ID.
- `name` (String) Name displayed in the Apstra web UI. Required when `id` is omitted.
- `route_target` (String) All interconnect gateways MUST use the same Interconnect Route Target (iRT).  The iRT is an additional unique RT for the interconnect domain.

Read-Only:

- `blueprint_id` (String) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
