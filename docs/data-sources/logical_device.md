# apstra_logical_device (Data Source)

This data source provides details about a specific logical device (a logical device is a template used by apstra when creating rack types (rack types are also templates)).

The logical device can be specified by id xor by name. Returns an error if 0 matches or more than 1 match. Note on looking up logical devices by name:

1. Apstra allows multiple logical devices to have the same name, although this is not recommended.
1. To lookup a logical device that shares a name with any other device(s) you must lookup by id.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# The following example shows how a module might accept a logical device name as an input variable and use it to retrieve the agent profile ID when provisioning a rack type.

variable "logical_device_name" {}

data "apstra_logical_device" "selected" {
    name = var.logical_device_name
}

resource "apstra_rack_type" "my_rack" {
    todo = "all of this"
}
```
