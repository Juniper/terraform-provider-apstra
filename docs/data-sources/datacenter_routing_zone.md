# apstra_datacenter_routing_zone (Data Source)

This resource returns details of a Routing Zone within a Datacenter Blueprint.

At least one optional attribute is required.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example pulls the details of a routing zone using
# manually-entered blueprint and routing zone IDs.
#
# In a production scenario it's more likely that these
# values would come from a lookup by name or from the
# read-only attributes of the resources which created
# them.

data "apstra_datacenter_routing_zone" "test" {
  blueprint_id = "13b8ddb4-f230-4727-ab0f-aa829551a129"
  id           = "b03V9dIBBqeQkcV69nY"
}

output "routing_zone" {
  value = data.apstra_datacenter_routing_zone.test
}

# The output looks like this:

# routing_zone = {
#   "blueprint_id" = "13b8ddb4-f230-4727-ab0f-aa829551a129"
#   "dhcp_servers" = toset([
#     "192.168.10.100",
#     "192.168.20.100",
#   ])
#   "id" = "b03V9dIBBqeQkcV69nY"
#   "name" = "bar"
#   "routing_policy_id" = "6QVA7utPgvPDWe0-vLs"
#   "vlan_id" = 43
#   "vni" = 10043

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID. Required when `id` is omitted.

### Optional

- `id` (String) Apstra graph node ID. Required when `name` is omitted.
- `name` (String) VRF name displayed in the Apstra web UI.

### Read-Only

- `dhcp_servers` (Set of String) Set of DHCP server IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of DHCP servers.
- `had_prior_vlan_id_config` (Boolean) Used to trigger plan modification when `vlan_id` has been removed from the configuration in managed resource context, this attribute will always be `null` and should be ignored in data source context.
- `had_prior_vni_config` (Boolean) Used to trigger plan modification when `vni` has been removed from the configuration in managed resource context, this attribute will always be `null` and should be ignored in data source context.
- `routing_policy_id` (String) Non-EVPN blueprints must use the default policy, so this field must be null. Set this attribute in an EVPN blueprint to use a non-default policy.
- `vlan_id` (Number) Used for VLAN tagged Layer 3 links on external connections. Leave this field blank to have it automatically assigned from a static pool in the range of 2-4094), or enter a specific value.
- `vni` (Number) VxLAN VNI associated with the routing zone. Leave this field blank to have it automatically assigned from an allocated resource pool, or enter a specific value.
