# apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domain_gateways (Data Source)

This data source returns Graph DB node IDs of Interconnect Domain Gateways within a Blueprint.

Optional `filters` can be used to select only interesting Interconnect Domain Gateways.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example outputs the names of Interconnect Domain Gateways which
# use Leaf 1 as the local gateway end.

# Discover the ID of Leaf 1
data "apstra_datacenter_systems" "leaf_1" {
  blueprint_id = "eb5bf749-3610-4c23-ade1-50a6cc200abf"
  filters      = [{ label = "leaf_1" }]
}

# Discover IDs of local Interconnect Domain Gateways peering with Leaf 1
data "apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domain_gateways" "with_leaf_1" {
  blueprint_id = "eb5bf749-3610-4c23-ade1-50a6cc200abf"
  filters      = [{ local_gateway_nodes = [one(data.apstra_datacenter_systems.leaf_1.ids)] }]
}

# Discover details (we need the name) of all local Interconnect Domain
# Gatways peering with Leaf 1
data "apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domain_gateway" "with_leaf_1" {
  for_each     = data.apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domain_gateways.with_leaf_1.ids
  blueprint_id = "eb5bf749-3610-4c23-ade1-50a6cc200abf"
  id           = each.value
}

# Surface the list of Interconnect Domain Gateway names available outside
# of this module
output "interconnect_domain_gateway_names" {
  value = sort([
    for gw in data.apstra_datacenter_interconnect_domain_gateway.with_leaf_1
    :
    gw.name
  ])
}

# Output:
#
#  interconnect_domain_gateway_names = [
#    "another_example",
#    "example",
#  ]
```

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint to search.

### Optional

- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters used to select only desired Interconnect Domain Gateways. To match a filter, all specified attributes must match (each attribute within a filter is AND-ed together). The returned IDs represent the gateways matched by all of the filters together (filters are OR-ed together). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))

### Read-Only

- `ids` (Set of String) IDs of matching `routing_policy` Graph DB nodes.

<a id="nestedatt--filters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filters`

Optional:

- `asn` (Number) Interconnect Domain Gateway AS Number
- `hold_time` (Number) BGP hold time (seconds).
- `id` (String) Apstra Object ID.
- `interconnect_domain_id` (String) ID of the Interconnect Domain to which this gateway belongs.
- `ip_address` (String) Interconnect Domain Gateway IP address
- `keepalive_time` (Number) BGP keepalive time (seconds).
- `local_gateway_nodes` (Set of String) Set of IDs of switch nodes which will be configured to peer with the Interconnect Domain Gateway
- `name` (String) Interconnect Domain Gateway name
- `password` (String, Sensitive) BGP TCP authentication password
- `ttl` (Number) BGP Time To Live. Omit to use device defaults.

Read-Only:

- `blueprint_id` (String) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
