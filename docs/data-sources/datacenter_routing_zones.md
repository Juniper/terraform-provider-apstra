# apstra_datacenter_routing_zones (Data Source)

This data source returns the IDs of Routing Zones within the specified Blueprint. All of the `filter` attributes are optional.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Without specifying no filter, a wide search is performed.
# All routing zones in the blueprint will match.
data "apstra_datacenter_routing_zones" "all" {
  blueprint_id = "05f9d3fc-671a-4efc-8e91-5ef87b2937d3"
}

# This example performs a very narrow search. Only one (or zero!)
# routing zones can match the resulting query.
data "apstra_datacenter_routing_zones" "rzs" {
  blueprint_id = "05f9d3fc-671a-4efc-8e91-5ef87b2937d3"
  filter = { # all filter attributes are optional
    name              = "customer_1"
    vlan_id           = 55
    vni               = 10055
    dhcp_servers      = ["192.168.5.100", "192.168.10.100"]
    routing_policy_id = "vqsv3F93MBHUgg5e8ws"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.

### Optional

- `filter` (Attributes, Deprecated) Routing Zone attributes used as a filter (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter))
- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters used to select only desired node IDs. For a node to match a filter, all specified attributes must match (each attribute within a filter is AND-ed together). The returned node IDs represent the nodes matched by all of the filters together (filters are OR-ed together). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))

### Read-Only

- `graph_queries` (List of String) Graph datastore queries which performed the lookup based on supplied filters.
- `ids` (Set of String) Set of Routing Zone IDs

### Nested Schema for `filter`

Optional:

- `dhcp_servers` (Set of String) Set of addresses of DHCP servers (IPv4 or IPv6) which must be configured in the Routing Zone. This is a list of *required* servers, not an exact-match list.
- `disable_ipv4` (Boolean) Only valid with `ip_addressing_type = "ipv6"`. When this is set `true`, pure ipv6 Routing Zones will not render IPv4 SAFIs and other ipv4-over-ipv6/RFC5549 related configuration will be removed. User-defined IPv4 resources will not be permitted in the Routing Zone. An IPv4 loopback is still required in order to derive BGP Router IDs and Route Distinguishers and it will not participate in routing. Requires Apstra version >=6.1.0
- `export_route_targets` (Set of String) This is a set of *required* RTs, not an exact-match list.
- `import_route_targets` (Set of String) This is a set of *required* RTs, not an exact-match list.
- `ip_addressing_type` (String) Defines if the according Routing Zone addresses resources with ipv4, ipv4+ipv6, or ipv6-only. Errors are raised if resources are created within the Routing Zone and that resource violates this addressing support value. Note that ipv4 is still permitted in an ipv6-only network, in which case `disable_ipv4` can be used to disallow ipv4 completely.
Must be one of `['ipv4','ipv4_ipv6','ipv6']`.
Requires Apstra version >=6.1.0
- `junos_evpn_irb_mode` (String) Symmetric IRB Routing for EVPN on Junos devices makes use of an L3 VNI for inter-subnet routing which is embedded into EVPN Type2-routes to support better scaling for networks with large amounts of VLANs.
- `name` (String) Name displayed in the Apstra web UI.
- `routing_policy_id` (String) Non-EVPN blueprints must use the default policy, so this field must be null. Set this attribute in an EVPN blueprint to use a non-default policy.
- `vlan_id` (Number) Used for VLAN tagged Layer 3 links on external connections.
- `vni` (Number) VxLAN VNI associated with the Routing Zone.
- `vrf_name` (String) VRF name.

Read-Only:

- `blueprint_id` (String) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
- `had_prior_vlan_id_config` (Boolean) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
- `had_prior_vni_config` (Boolean) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
- `id` (String) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
