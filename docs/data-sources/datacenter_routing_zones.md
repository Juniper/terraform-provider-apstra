# apstra_datacenter_routing_zones (Data Source)

This data source returns the IDs of Routing Zones within the specified Blueprint. All of the `filter` attributes are optional.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Without specifying no filter, a wide search is performed.
# All routing zones in the blueprint will match.
data "apstra_datacenter_routing_zones" "all" {
  blueprint_id = "05f9d3fc-671a-4efc-8e91-5ef87b2937d3"
}

# This example performs a very narrow search. Only one (or zero!)
# routing zones can match the resulting query.
data "apstra_datacenter_routing_zones" "rzs" {
  blueprint_id = "05f9d3fc-671a-4efc-8e91-5ef87b2937d3"
  filter = { # all filter attributes are optional
    name              = "customer_1"
    vlan_id           = 55
    vni               = 10055
    dhcp_servers      = ["192.168.5.100", "192.168.10.100"]
    routing_policy_id = "vqsv3F93MBHUgg5e8ws"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.

### Optional

- `filter` (Attributes, Deprecated) Routing Zone attributes used as a filter (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filter))
- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters used to select only desired node IDs. For a node to match a filter, all specified attributes must match (each attribute within a filter is AND-ed together). The returned node IDs represent the nodes matched by all of the filters together (filters are OR-ed together). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))

### Read-Only

- `graph_queries` (List of String) Graph datastore queries which performed the lookup based on supplied filters.
- `ids` (Set of String) Set of Routing Zone IDs

### Nested Schema for `filter`

Optional:

- `dhcp_servers` (Set of String) Set of addresses of DHCP servers (IPv4 or IPv6) which must be configured in the Routing Zone. This is a list of *required* servers, not an exact-match list.
- `export_route_targets` (Set of String) This is a set of *required* RTs, not an exact-match list.
- `import_route_targets` (Set of String) This is a set of *required* RTs, not an exact-match list.
- `junos_irb_mode` (String) Symmetric IRB Routing for EVPN on Junos devices makes use of an L3 VNI for inter-subnet routing which is embedded into EVPN Type2-routes to support better scaling for networks with large amounts of VLANs.
- `name` (String) VRF name displayed in the Apstra web UI.
- `routing_policy_id` (String) Non-EVPN blueprints must use the default policy, so this field must be null. Set this attribute in an EVPN blueprint to use a non-default policy.
- `vlan_id` (Number) Used for VLAN tagged Layer 3 links on external connections.
- `vni` (Number) VxLAN VNI associated with the routing zone.

Read-Only:

- `blueprint_id` (String) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
- `had_prior_vlan_id_config` (Boolean) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
- `had_prior_vni_config` (Boolean) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
- `id` (String) Not applicable in filter context. Ignore.
