# apstra_freeform_resource (Data Source)

This data source provides details of a specific Freeform Resource.

At least one optional attribute is required.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example creates an ASN resource with the value 65535 within a
# preexisting resource group in a Freeform Blueprint.
#
# After creating the Resource, the data source is invoked to look up
# the details.
resource "apstra_freeform_resource" "test" {
  blueprint_id  = "631f8832-ae59-40ca-b4f6-9c19b411aeaf"
  name          = "aa"
  type          = "asn"
  group_id      = "Sj7LlWkPucErjSDx4vc"
  integer_value = "65535"
}

data "apstra_freeform_resource" "test" {
  blueprint_id = "631f8832-ae59-40ca-b4f6-9c19b411aeaf"
  id           = apstra_freeform_resource.test.id
}

output "test_resource_out" { value = data.apstra_freeform_resource.test }

# The output looks like:
# test_resource_out = {
#   "allocated_from" = tostring(null)
#   "blueprint_id" = "631f8832-ae59-40ca-b4f6-9c19b411aeaf"
#   "generator_id" = tostring(null)
#   "group_id" = "Sj7LlWkPucErjSDx4vc"
#   "id" = "OkPxk02GAGN5H8z9FWU"
#   "integer_value" = 65535
#   "ipv4_value" = tostring(null)
#   "ipv6_value" = tostring(null)
#   "name" = "aa"
#   "type" = "asn"
# }

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID. Used to identify the Blueprint where the Resource lives.

### Optional

- `id` (String) Populate this field to look up the Freeform Resource by ID. Required when `name` is omitted.
- `name` (String) Populate this field to look up Resource by Name. Required when `id` is omitted.

### Read-Only

- `allocated_from` (String) ID of the node from which this resource has been sourced. This could be an ID of resource allocation group or another resource (in case of IP or Host IP allocations). This also can be empty. In that case it is required that value for this resource is provided by thex user.
- `assigned_to` (Set of String) Set of node IDs to which the resource is assigned.
- `generator_id` (String) ID of the group generator that created the group, if any.
- `group_id` (String) Resource Group the Resource belongs to.
- `integer_value` (Number) Value used by integer type resources (`asn`, `integer`, `vlan`, `vni`). Also used by IP prefix resources (`ipv4` and `ipv6`) to indicate the required prefix size for automatic allocations from another object or a resource pool.
- `ipv4_value` (String) Value used by resources with type `ipv4` or `host_ipv4`.
- `ipv6_value` (String) Value used by resources with type `ipv6` or `host_ipv6`.
- `type` (String) Type of the Resource
