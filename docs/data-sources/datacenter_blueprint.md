# apstra_datacenter_blueprint (Data Source)

This data source looks up summary details of a Datacenter Blueprint.

At least one optional attribute is required.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example looks up a blueprint by name and uses the returned ID
# and build status fields to deploy the blueprint as needed, so long
# as it's error-free.

# Look up the blueprint by name.
data "apstra_datacenter_blueprint" "status" {
  name = "terraform commit example"
}

# Evaluate relevant fields from the returned status, determine
# whether it's safe/appropriate to attempt a deployment.
locals {
  has_changes = data.apstra_datacenter_blueprint.status.has_uncommitted_changes
  error_free = data.apstra_datacenter_blueprint.status.build_errors_count == 0
  build_when = local.has_changes && local.error_free
}

# Conditionally deploy the blueprint based on the assessment above.
resource "apstra_blueprint_deployment" "as_needed" {
  count = local.build_when ? 1 : 0
  blueprint_id = data.apstra_datacenter_blueprint.status.id
  comment      = "Deployment by Terraform {{.TerraformVersion}}, Apstra provider {{.ProviderVersion}}, User $USER."
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `id` (String) ID of the Blueprint. Required when `name` is omitted.
- `name` (String) Name of the Blueprint. Required when `id` is omitted.

### Read-Only

- `access_switch_count` (Number) The count of access switches in the topology.
- `build_errors_count` (Number) Number of build errors.
- `build_warnings_count` (Number) Number of build warnings.
- `esi_mac_msb` (Number) ESI MAC address most significant byte.
- `external_router_count` (Number) The count of external routers attached to the topology.
- `fabric_addressing` (String) Addressing scheme for both superspine/spine and spine/leaf links.
- `fabric_mtu` (Number) MTU of fabric links. Requires Apstra 4.2 or later.
- `generic_system_count` (Number) The count of generic systems in the topology.
- `has_uncommitted_changes` (Boolean) Indicates whether the staging blueprint has uncommitted changes.
- `ipv6_applications` (Boolean) Enables support for IPv6 virtual networks and IPv6 external connectivity points.
