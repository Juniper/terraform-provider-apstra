# APSTRA Provider

The Apstra provider allows Terraform to control Juniper Apstra fabrics.

At this time, it covers day 0 and day 1 operations (design and deployment).
Broadly speaking, these capabilities include everything on Apstra's Design and
Resource panels, plus the ability to instantiate a new blueprint from a template.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Configuration

### Provider configuration stanza

```terraform
provider "apstra" {
  url                     = "https://apstra.example.com" # required
  tls_validation_disabled = true                         # optional
}
```

### Environment Variables

Users are encouraged to set the Apstra credentials using environment variables:
```shell
APSTRA_USER=admin
APSTRA_PASS=password
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `blueprint_mutex_disabled` (Boolean) Blueprint mutexes are signals that changes are being made in the staging Blueprint and other automation processes (including other instances of Terraform)  should wait before beginning to make changes of their own. Set this attribute 'true' to skip locking the mutex(es) which signal exclusive Blueprint access for all Blueprint changes made in this project.
- `blueprint_mutex_message` (String) Blueprint mutexes are signals that changes are being made in the staging Blueprint and other automation processes (including other instances of Terraform)  should wait before beginning to make changes of their own. The mutexes embed a human-readable field to reduce confusion in the event a mutex needs to be cleared manually. This attribute overrides the default message in that field: "locked by terraform at $DATE".
- `tls_validation_disabled` (Boolean) Set 'true' to disable TLS certificate validation.
- `url` (String) URL of the apstra server, e.g. `https://<user>:<password>@apstra.juniper.net:443/`
If username or password are omitted from URL string, environment variables `APSTRA_USER` and `APSTRA_PASS` will be used.  If `url` is omitted, environment variable APSTRA_URL will be used.
