# Apstra Provider

The Apstra provider allows Terraform to control Juniper Apstra fabrics.

At this time, it covers day 0 and day 1 operations (design and deployment).
Broadly speaking, these capabilities include everything on Apstra's Design and
Resource panels, plus the ability to instantiate a new blueprint from a template.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Configuration

### Provider configuration stanza

```terraform
provider "apstra" {
  url                     = "https://apstra.example.com" # required
  tls_validation_disabled = true                         # optional
}
```

### Environment Variables

Users are encouraged to set the Apstra credentials using environment variables:
```shell
APSTRA_USER=admin
APSTRA_PASS=password
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_timeout` (Number) Timeout in seconds for completing API transactions with the Apstra server. Omit for default value of 10 seconds. Value of 0 results in infinite timeout.
- `blueprint_mutex_enabled` (Boolean) Blueprint mutexes are indicators that changes are being made in a staging Blueprint and other automation processes (including other instances of Terraform) should wait before beginning to make changes of their own. Setting this attribute 'true' causes the provider to lock a blueprint-specific mutex before making any changes. [More info here](https://github.com/Juniper/terraform-provider-apstra/blob/main/kb/blueprint_mutex.md).
- `blueprint_mutex_message` (String) Blueprint mutexes are signals that changes are being made in a staging Blueprint and other automation processes (including other instances of Terraform) should wait before beginning to make changes of their own. The mutexes embed a human-readable field to reduce confusion in the event a mutex needs to be cleared manually. This attribute overrides the default message in that field: "locked by terraform at $DATE".
- `experimental` (Boolean) Sets a flag in the underlying Apstra SDK client object which enables *experimental* features. At this time, the only effect is bypassing version compatibility checks in the SDK. This provider release is tested with Apstra versions 4.1.0, 4.1.1, and 4.1.2.
- `tls_validation_disabled` (Boolean) Set 'true' to disable TLS certificate validation.
- `url` (String) URL of the apstra server, e.g. `https://apstra.example.com`

It is possible to include Apstra API credentials in the URL using [standard syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738#section-3.1). Care should be taken to ensure that these credentials aren't accidentally committed to version control, etc... The preferred approach is to pass the credentials as environment variables `APSTRA_USER`  and `APSTRA_PASS`.

If `url` is omitted, environment variable `APSTRA_URL` can be used to in its place.

When the username or password are embedded in the URL string, any special characters must be URL-encoded. For example, `pass^word` would become `pass%5eword`.
