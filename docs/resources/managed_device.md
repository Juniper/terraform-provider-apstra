# apstra_managed_device (Resource)

This resource creates/installs an Agent for an Apstra Managed Device.Optionally, it will 'Acknowledge' the discovered system if the `device key` (serial number)reported by the agent matches the optional `device_key` field.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example searches for an Agent Profile matching:
# - platform: "junos"
# - has_username: true
# - has_password: true
#
# It then uses that Agent Profile to create a Managed Device resource for
# a device at a known Management IP. Because the serial number is known
# in advance, the Managed Device will be automaticall "acknowledged" in
# Apstra's "Devices -> Managed Devices" list.

# Get a list of all Agent Profile IDs
data "apstra_agent_profiles" "all" {}

# Use the Agent Profile IDs to pull details about each Agent Profile
data "apstra_agent_profile" "each" {
  for_each = data.apstra_agent_profiles.all.ids
  id       = each.key
}

# Filter the Agent Profile map to include only those with
# credentials for Junos boxes.
locals {
  agent_profiles_id_with_credentials_and_qfx_in_name = [
    for dp in data.apstra_agent_profile.each :
    dp.id if length(regexall("qfx", lower(dp.name))) >= 1 &&
    dp.platform == "junos" &&
    dp.has_username &&
    dp.has_password
  ]
}

# Create the Managed Device resource with a serial number (device key)
# so that the system will be automatically "acknowledged"
resource "apstra_managed_device" "example" {
  agent_profile_id = local.agent_profiles_id_with_credentials_and_qfx_in_name[0]
  device_key = "52540057C718"
  management_ip = "172.20.84.15"
  off_box = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `agent_profile_id` (String) ID of the Agent Profile used when instantiating the Agent. An Agent Profile isrequired to specify the login credentials and platform type.
- `management_ip` (String) Management IP address of the system.
- `off_box` (Boolean) Indicates that an *offbox* agent should be created (required for Junos devices, default: `true`)

### Optional

- `device_key` (String) Key which uniquely identifies a System asset. Possibly a MAC address or serial number.

### Read-Only

- `agent_id` (String) Apstra ID for the Managed Device Agent.
- `system_id` (String) Apstra ID for the System onboarded by the Managed Device Agent.
