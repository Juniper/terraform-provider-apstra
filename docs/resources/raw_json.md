**!!! Warning !!!**
This is an *experimental* resource intended only to solve problems not addressed by the normal resources.Use is discouraged and not supported. You're on your own with this thing.
**!!! Warning !!!**

This resource creates an object from a raw JSON payload via `POST` request. It assumes that the API will respond with a payload containing the new object ID: `{"id": "xxxxxxxx"}`. Config drift detection is not implemented, but update-in-place should be possible.. The `Update()` and `Delete()` functions append the ID (`/xxxxxxxx`) to the URL.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example uses the `apstra_raw_json` resource to create an IP pool.

# Don't ever do this. Use the `apstra_ipv4_pool` resource instead.

resource "apstra_raw_json" "example" {
  url = "/api/resources/ip-pools"
  payload = jsonencode(
    {
      display_name = "test pool"
      subnets = [
        {
          network = "10.0.0.0/22"
        },
      ]
    }
  )
}
