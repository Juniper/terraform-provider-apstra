# apstra_datacenter_ip_link_addressing (Resource)

This resource creates IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on L3 subinterfaces within a Datacenter Blueprint fabric. It is intended for use with subinterfaces created as a side-effect of assigning Connectivity Templates containing IP Link primitives.


## Example Usage

```terraform
#
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.
- `link_id` (String) Apstra graph node ID of the logical Link created by assigning a Connectivity Template with an IP Link primitive to a switch port. Note that CT assignment will create a logical link for each IP Link primitive. This resource is concerned with a single logical link. CTs which include multiple IP Link primitives may require multiple instances of this resource.

### Optional

- `generic_ipv4_address` (String) IPv4 address in CIDR notation.
- `generic_ipv4_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`none`,`numbered`]
- `generic_ipv6_address` (String) IPv6 address in CIDR notation.
- `generic_ipv6_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`link_local`,`none`,`numbered`]
- `switch_ipv4_address` (String) IPv4 address in CIDR notation.
- `switch_ipv4_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`none`,`numbered`]
- `switch_ipv6_address` (String) IPv6 address in CIDR notation.
- `switch_ipv6_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`link_local`,`none`,`numbered`]

### Read-Only

- `generic_interface_id` (String) Apstra graph node ID of the node with which IP addresses will be associated.
- `switch_interface_id` (String) Apstra graph node ID of the node with which IP addresses will be associated.
