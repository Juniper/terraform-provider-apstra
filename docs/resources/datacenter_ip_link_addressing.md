# apstra_datacenter_ip_link_addressing (Resource)

This resource creates IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on L3 subinterfaces within a Datacenter Blueprint fabric. It is intended for use with subinterfaces created as a side-effect of assigning Connectivity Templates containing IP Link primitives.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example configures link numbering on a logical link between a leaf
# switch and a generic system. The link identified by "link_id" was created
# as a side-effect of attaching a Connectivity Template containing one or
# more IP Link primitives.
resource "apstra_datacenter_ip_link_addressing" "x" {
  blueprint_id = "22044be2-e7af-462d-847a-ce6d0b49000e"
  link_id      = "sz:HuZK45zx7V15D4qrjz0,vlan:22,a_001_leaf1<->a(link-000000001)[1]"

  switch_ipv4_address_type = "numbered"        # none | numbered
  switch_ipv4_address      = "192.0.2.0/31"
  switch_ipv6_address_type = "numbered"        # none | link_local | numbered
  switch_ipv6_address      = "2001:db8::1/127"

  generic_ipv4_address_type = "numbered"       # none | numbered
  generic_ipv4_address      = "192.0.2.1/31"
  generic_ipv6_address_type = "numbered"       # none | link_local | numbered
  generic_ipv6_address      = "2001:db8::2/127"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.
- `link_id` (String) Apstra graph node ID of the logical Link created by assigning a Connectivity Template with an IP Link primitive to a switch port. Note that CT assignment will create a logical link for each IP Link primitive. This resource is concerned with a single logical link. CTs which include multiple IP Link primitives may require multiple instances of this resource.

### Optional

- `generic_ipv4_address` (String) IPv4 address in CIDR notation.
- `generic_ipv4_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`none`,`numbered`]
- `generic_ipv6_address` (String) IPv6 address in CIDR notation.
- `generic_ipv6_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`link_local`,`none`,`numbered`]
- `switch_ipv4_address` (String) IPv4 address in CIDR notation.
- `switch_ipv4_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`none`,`numbered`]
- `switch_ipv6_address` (String) IPv6 address in CIDR notation.
- `switch_ipv6_address_type` (String) Allowed values: [`link_local`,`none`,`numbered`]

### Read-Only

- `generic_interface_id` (String) Apstra graph node ID of the node with which IP addresses will be associated.
- `switch_interface_id` (String) Apstra graph node ID of the node with which IP addresses will be associated.
