# apstra_datacenter_connectivity_template_assignments (Resource)

This resource assigns a Connectivity Template to one or more Application Points. Application Points are graph nodes including interfaces at the fabric edge, and switches within the fabric.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example assigns connectivity template ef77e286-be82-4855-baaf-269d2a0ed893
# to four different switch ports.

# identified by the ID "FkYtMBdeoJ5urBaIEi8"
#
# Data sources like these can be used to find node IDs to use in
# the `application_point_ids` attribute:
# - apstra_datacenter_svis_map
# - apstra_datacenter_interfaces_by_link_tag
# - apstra_datacenter_interfaces_by_system

resource "apstra_datacenter_connectivity_template_assignments" "a" {
  blueprint_id             = "0b1d5276-37e0-46fb-8d35-b8932015e56c"
  connectivity_template_id = "ef77e286-be82-4855-baaf-269d2a0ed893"
  application_point_ids = [

## Schema

### Required

- `application_point_ids` (Set of String) Set of Apstra node IDs of the Interfaces or Systems where the Connectivity Template should be applied.
- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.
- `connectivity_template_id` (String) Connectivity Template ID which should be applied to the Application Points.

### Optional

- `fetch_ip_link_ids` (Boolean) When `true`, the read-only `ip_link_ids` attribute will be populated. Default behavior skips retrieving `ip_link_ids` to improve performance in scenarios where this information is not needed.

### Read-Only

- `ip_link_ids` (Map of Map of String) New Logical Links are created when Connectivity Templates containing *IP Link* primitives are attached to a switch interface. These logical links may or may not be VLAN-tagged. This attribute is a two-dimensional map. The outer map is keyed by Application Point ID. The inner map is keyed by VLAN number. Untagged Logical Links are represented in the inner map by key `0`.
**Note:** requires `fetch_ip_link_ids = true`
