# apstra_datacenter_device_allocation (Resource)

This resource allocates a Managed Device (probably a switch) to a node role (spine1, etc...) within a Blueprint.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example deploys a blueprint from a template and assigns
# interface maps to the fabric nodes.

# Instantiate the blueprint from the template
resource "apstra_datacenter_blueprint" "r" {
  name        = "example blueprint with switch allocation"
  template_id = "L2_Virtual_EVPN"
}

# Only one of "device_key" and "interface_map_id" is required in most cases.
#
# When only the interface_map_id is provided, we set the interface map (this
# step eliminates build errors), but do not assign systems by ID.
#
# When only the device_key is provided, we try to infer the interface_map_id
# by first determining the device type, and then looking for candidate
# interface maps which can map the specific hardware to the logical device
# specified by the fabric role. When multiple candidate interface maps exist
# supplying interface_map_id becomes mandatory.
locals {
  switches = {
    spine1 = {
#     device_key       = "<serial-number-goes-here>"
      interface_map_id = "Juniper_vQFX__AOS-7x10-Spine"
    }
    spine2 = {
#     device_key       = "<serial-number-goes-here>"
      interface_map_id = "Juniper_vQFX__AOS-7x10-Spine"
    }
    l2_virtual_001_leaf1 = {
#     device_key       = "<serial-number-goes-here>"
      interface_map_id = "Juniper_vQFX__AOS-7x10-Leaf"
    }
    l2_virtual_002_leaf1 = {
#     device_key       = "<serial-number-goes-here>"
      interface_map_id = "Juniper_vQFX__AOS-7x10-Leaf"
    }
    l2_virtual_003_leaf1 = {
#     device_key       = "<serial-number-goes-here>"
      interface_map_id = "Juniper_vQFX__AOS-7x10-Leaf"
    }
    l2_virtual_004_leaf1 = {
#     device_key       = "<serial-number-goes-here>"
      interface_map_id = "Juniper_vQFX__AOS-7x10-Leaf"
    }
  }
}

# Assign switches to fabric roles
resource "apstra_datacenter_blueprint_device_allocation" "r" {
  for_each         = local.switches
  blueprint_id     = apstra_datacenter_blueprint.r.id
  interface_map_id = each.value["interface_map_id"]
  node_name        = each.key
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.
- `node_name` (String) GraphDB node 'label which identifies the switch. Strings like 'spine1' and 'rack_2_leaf_1' are appropriate here.

### Optional

- `device_key` (String) Unique ID for a Managed Device, generally the serial number, used to. assign a Managed Device to a fabric role.
- `interface_map_id` (String) Interface Maps link a Logical Device (fabric design element) to a Device Profile which describes a hardware model. This field is required when `device_key` is omitted, or when `device_key` is supplied, but does not provide enough information to`. select an Interface Map. This field represents the Blueprint graphDB node ID, which is the same string as the global ID used in the design API global catalog.

### Read-Only

- `device_profile_node_id` (String) Device Profiles specify attributes of specific hardware models.
- `node_id` (String) GraphDB Node ID of the fabric node to which we're allocating an Interface Map and Managed Device.
