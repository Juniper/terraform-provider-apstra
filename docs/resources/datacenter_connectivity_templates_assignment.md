# apstra_datacenter_connectivity_templates_assignment (Resource)

This resource assigns one or more Connectivity Templates to an Application Point. Application Points are graph nodes including interfaces at the fabric edge, and switches within the fabric.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example assigns two connectivity templates to the switch port
# identified by the ID "FkYtMBdeoJ5urBaIEi8"
#
# Data sources like these can be used to find node IDs to use in
# the `application_point_id` attribute:
# - apstra_datacenter_svis_map
# - apstra_datacenter_interfaces_by_link_tag
# - apstra_datacenter_interfaces_by_system

resource "apstra_datacenter_connectivity_template_assignment" "a" {
  blueprint_id              = "b726704d-f80e-4733-9103-abd6ccd8752c"
  application_point_id      = "FkYtMBdeoJ5urBaIEi8"
  connectivity_template_ids = [
    "bcbcb35f-8f23-4bfb-916e-1b21d07d6904",
    "1f8ac61f-6996-42bb-a34f-4f4a50a7111a",
  ]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `application_point_id` (String) Apstra node ID of the Interface or System where the Connectivity Templates should be applied.
- `blueprint_id` (String) Apstra Blueprint ID.
- `connectivity_template_ids` (Set of String) Set of Connectivity Template IDs which should be applied to the Application Point.

### Optional

- `fetch_ip_link_ids` (Boolean) When `true`, the read-only `ip_link_ids` attribute will be populated. Default behavior skips retrieving `ip_link_ids` to improve performance in scenarios where this information is not needed.

### Read-Only

- `ip_links_ids` (Map of Map of String) New Logical Links are created when Connectivity Templates containing *IP Link* primitives are attached to a switch interface. These logical links may or may not be VLAN-tagged. This attribute is a two-dimensional map. The outer map is keyed by Connectivity Template ID. The inner map is keyed by VLAN number. Untagged Logical Links are represented in the inner map by key `0`.
**Note:** requires `fetch_iplink_ids = true`
