## Schema

### Optional

- `warn_seconds` (Number) Terraform will produce a warning when the token value is referenced with less than this amount of time remaining before expiration. Note that determination of remaining token lifetime depends on clock sync between the Apstra server and the Terraform host. Value `0` disables warnings. Default value is `60`.

### Read-Only

- `session_id` (String) The API session ID associated with the token.
- `user_name` (String) The user name associated with the session ID.
- `value` (String) The API token value.
