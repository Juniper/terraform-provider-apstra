# {{ .ProviderShortName | title }} Provider

The Apstra provider allows Terraform to control Juniper Apstra fabrics.

At this time, it covers day 0 and day 1 operations (design and deployment).
Broadly speaking, these capabilities include everything on Apstra's Design and
Resource panels, plus the ability to instantiate a new blueprint from a template.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.
